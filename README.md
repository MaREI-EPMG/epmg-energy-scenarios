# EPMG Energy Scenarios

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MaREI-EPMG/epmg-energy-scenarios?color=purple)](LICENSE)

This web app is developed to provide a convenient way of exploring EPMG energy scenarios using modern web technologies. [Olexandr Balyk](https://github.com/olejandro) is the creator of the app. [Andrew Z. P. Smith](https://github.com/energynumbers) is the current maintainer.

This particular app, on MaREI-EPMG/epmg-energy-scenarios , is directly imported into the netlify app at https://epmg.netlify.app/ to make the front page there.

TIM results to be displayed in the app should be processed with [MaREI-EPMG/tim-scenario-json](https://github.com/MaREI-EPMG/tim-scenario-json)

The json files can then be put into a fork of [MaREI-EPMG/epmg-scenarios-template](https://github.com/MaREI-EPMG/epmg-scenarios-template) . Follow the instruction **there** to ensure that they are displayed in the netlify app.
