# Energy Charts

This is the bespoke UCC-EPMG version of Energy Charts, customised from the [orginal software](https://github.com/facilitate-energy/energy-charts) developed by [Facilitate Energy Ltd.](https://facilitate.energy/)

## Purpose

Energy Charts is a React component, and a standalone web application, developed to:

- make it easier to communicate energy modelling results and scenarios to stakeholders;
- facilitate discussion of energy modelling results and make model debugging easier;
- disseminate energy modelling results and scenarios to a wide audience.

## Invoking

Although config.js isn't used when it's run as embedded, it is included here, 
as it has documentation on some of the settings that you may want to use.


## To use as dependency

To use Energy Charts as dependency in a project run:

`npm install energy-charts --save-prod`

## To run locally (in general, you don't want to do this)

After cloning from GitHub, execute from within the repository:

`npm install`

Followed by:

`npm start`

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## To deploy (and you won't, in general, want to do this either)

Follow this [guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) to deploy on Netlify.
